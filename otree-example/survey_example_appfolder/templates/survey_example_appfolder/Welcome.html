<h2> First Survey of Julia Schlei√üheimer </h2>
    <hr> 
    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    This is my first survey for the tutorial of the seminar "Designing and implementing
    online survey experiments". <br> This just demonstrates a few types of different questions that can be asked in a survey. 
    <br> Have fun clicking through!

    <!-- This is the most basic way of implementing an input field -->
    {{ formfield "entry_question"}}

   <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary next-button otree-next-button">
    Next
</button>
